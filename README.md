# Simons_Game

This was really a very fun game which I made during my frontend learning days.

How to play

In each turn, the game will play the sequence, and then wait for the user to repeat the sequence by pressing the buttons according to the color sequence. If the user repeated the sequence correctly, the game will play a "leveling-up" sound, add a new color at the end of the sequence, and move to the next turn.
